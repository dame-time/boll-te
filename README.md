## 🌟 Theme Inspiration: Bubbles

The Game Jam’s theme, **Bubbles**, inspired us to design a game around the chaotic joy of bubble tea preparation. We wanted to recreate the **fun and frenzy** of a bubble tea shop with an emphasis on **fast-paced challenges** and **satisfying gameplay loops**.

Drawing inspiration from Overcooked, we’ve crafted a cartoonish, lighthearted environment where:

- **Animations and SFX** immerse you in a whimsical, stress-inducing experience that’s still incredibly fun!
